                  <h3>A few words about me</h3>
                  <p>My name is Andrei Bucur, I am 21 years old, born and raised in Romania.I am a very ambitious person and once I decide to do something, it's pretty hard to stop me from doing so, I like working with people, I like going out on trips, I like pasta a lot and cats, can't forget about the cats, and I like to joke a lot, I joke so much that some people may think I don't take life seriously, but I do,trust me, or not :).And I want to welcome you to my journey, through this website I am going to post updates about my projects.</p>
                  <h3>Job experience </h3>
                  <p>My first job was as a worker in a retail store, so there it was the moment that I got rid of the fear of talking with people, I understood what it means to satisfy someone's needs and suggest the best product.My second job funny enough was in telesales, here I really got the opportunity to expand my understanding of working in a team and really be proactive, a good listener and a problem solver, after my entire team was transferred from telesales to customer support, I really perfected my skills so I can know a customer inside out and really think ahead of him, and when it comes to teams, I really know how to get along with everybody.
                  <h3>What I have been doing lately</h3>
                  <p>
                  I had a computer since I was 7 years old, but I never took the risk to understand how things work on the inside, how this brain do stuff, so I first picked up an ethical hacking course because, hey once you know how to mess things up you will know how to fix them, and later on I did a bug bounty hunting course as well because I know web application can be the sweet spot for hackers.But right now I chose a different path, since I've been doing troubleshooting for quite some time, I decided to pick a coding language and expand my skills.Right now I am fiddling around with Python
                ,I already did some projects,did some scripts, I know how to do data scraping using a library like BeautifulSoup4, how to do web apps using flask, I know how to use frameworks like Selenium for automation testing, Jupyter Notebooks for Data science and machine learning, and I am constantly learning and trying to improve myself and my skill set everyday.</p>
